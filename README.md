# UI-Router 

**Finally a defacto solution to nested routing.**

*Currently in alpha, check back soon for stable version*


## **Main Goal**
To evolve the concept of an Angular "Route" into a more general concept of a "State" for managing coarse application UI states.

## **Main Features:**
1. A state manager `$stateProvider` and `$state`, keeps state logic separate from routing logic.
2. Nested states (parent/child relationships).
3. Can set multiple views via named views. `ui-view` directive.
4. URL Routing
5. Backwards compatible with Angular v1 router
6. Various other nuggets of goodness
