# UI-Router

Finally a de-facto solution to nested views and routing.


## Main Goal
To evolve the concept of an Angular "Route" into a more general concept of a "State" for managing coarse application UI states.

## Main Features
1. A state manager `$stateProvider` and `$state`, keeps state logic separate from routing logic.
2. Nested states (parent/child relationships).
3. Can set multiple views via named views. `ui-view` directive.
4. URL Routing
5. Backwards compatible with Angular v1 router
6. Various other nuggets of goodness
