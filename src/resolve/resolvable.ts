/**
 * The basic building block for the resolve system.
 *
 * Resolvables encapsulate a state's resolve's resolveFn, the resolveFn's declared dependencies, the wrapped (.promise),
 * and the unwrapped-when-complete (.data) result of the resolveFn.
 *
 * Resolvable.get() either retrieves the Resolvable's existing promise, or else invokes resolve() (which invokes the
 * resolveFn) and returns the resulting promise.
 *
 * Resolvable.get() and Resolvable.resolve() both execute within a context Path, which is passed as the first
 * parameter to those fns.
